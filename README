Briska AM; Uhlrich DJ; Lytton, WW.  Computer model of passive signal integration 
based on whole-cell in vitro studies of rat lateral geniculate nucleus. 
European Journal of Neuroscience, 17:1531-1541, 2003.

This simulation reproduces the morphologies and charging curves for 2 thalamocortical 
cells and 2 thalamic interneurons as in Fig. 1 of the above paper.

Note: parameters (Ra,Rm,Cm) are not the same as those shown in Fig. 1; instead the 
standard parameters from TABLE 2 are used

This simulation can be auto-launched from ModelDB or downloaded as a zip file.
After unzipping the simulation can be run by typing
nrngui mosinit.hoc
on PC or unix or by double clicking on the mosinit.hoc file on the PC.

scholl.hoc may be run from neuron main menu's "load hoc" or the oc command line:
oc>load_file("scholl.hoc")
which will plot Scholl(*) plots for these four cells (these plots show the 
number of processes from a cell that stradle each distance from the soma).

motor cortices of the rat. J Anat 87: 387-406, 1953
